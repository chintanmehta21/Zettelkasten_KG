"""Shared runner for the DenseVerify phase.

Each per-source summarizer needs the same DV lifecycle: compute-or-cache the
``DenseVerifyResult``, feed ``missing_facts`` into the structured extractor,
then conditionally emit a flash patch when the structured payload still omits
a DV-flagged fact. This module centralizes that logic so every summarizer
stays at the 3-call budget without re-implementing it.

This module never calls CoD / SelfCheck / Patch — those modules are being
retired in favor of DenseVerify. The optional post-structured "patch" here
is a single flash call that rewrites one field (brief + any missing bullets)
with the unincluded facts appended; it is NOT the old Pro-tier SummaryPatcher.
