"""YouTube-specific prompt templates.

The base ``STRUCTURED_EXTRACT_INSTRUCTION`` is format-agnostic. When upstream
routing has classified the video format (documentary, commentary, lecture,
explainer, interview), :func:`select_youtube_prompt` returns a prompt that
prepends a short format-specific guidance block to the base instruction so the
model emphasises the right structural beats (chapters for lectures, the
guest's central claim for interviews, etc.) without changing the JSON schema
the structured extractor expects.
