## Metering Rules

- Zettel entitlement is checked before `/api/summarize` starts extraction or Gemini work.
- Kasten entitlement is checked before `POST /api/rag/sandboxes` creates a sandbox.
- RAG question entitlement is checked before retrieval, rerank, or Gemini answer work starts.
- Subscription quota is consumed before one-time credit packs.
- One-time packs act as overflow credits after included subscription quota is exhausted.
- Quota-blocked UI must preserve the interrupted action and resume it automatically after verified purchase.

## UX Rules

- Every quota prompt must offer a direct purchase path.
- "Watch an ad" is a disabled coming-soon action in this release and grants no credits.
- No flow may ask the user to manually retry after successful purchase.
- Known surfaces include Home Add Zettel, My Zettels Add Zettel, Home Kasten creation, My Kastens creation, Knowledge Graph Kasten modal, and User RAG questions.
