"""iter-12 Class D-out: gazetteer removed from THEMATIC branch.

iter-11 added gazetteer + HyDE to short-THEMATIC queries. iter-12 removes it:
short-THEMATIC now routes to VAGUE via Q7 regex (router.py) where the
gazetteer fires naturally. The THEMATIC branch uses only multi-query paraphrases.
VAGUE branch keeps expand_vague; iter-13 K6 replaces it with LLM.
